What drives the price of a car?

OVERVIEW
In this application, we explored a dataset from kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing. Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

CRISP-DM Framework
To frame the task, throughout our practical applications we will refer back to a standard process in industry for data projects called CRISP-DM. This process provides a framework for working through a data problem. Your first step in this application will be to read through a brief overview of CRISP-DM here. After reading the overview, answer the questions below.

Business Understanding
From a business perspective, we are tasked with identifying key drivers for used car prices. In the CRISP-DM overview, we are asked to convert this business framing to a data problem definition. Using a few sentences, reframe the task as a data task with the appropriate technical vocabulary.

The following steps were taken to analyse the used car data Data Understanding Data Prep Modelling Evaluation

Findings: The following are the important findings of this review :
This plot shows the importance of each feature in the data set , Top 3 important features that drive the car price are

Year of manufacture\n
The number of cylinders in the car
Transmission

The other important features 

Paint color
Car type (van, suv, sedan, cuv etc)
Manufacturer
Condition It is suprising to see that the fuel type and odometer mileage are not a significant factors in determing the price of the car.

Fuel Type: It's surprising that the fuel type (e.g., gasoline, diesel) does not have a significant impact on the car's price. This could suggest that other factors, such as efficiency or environmental concerns, are not major considerations for buyers in this dataset.
Odometer Mileage: Similarly, the odometer mileage, which typically reflects the car's usage and wear, is not a significant factor in determining the price. This could indicate that buyers are more focused on other aspects of the car's condition or features.
Overall, these findings provide valuable insights into the factors that drive car prices in the dataset. Understanding the relative importance of each feature can help stakeholders, such as car manufacturers, dealerships, and consumers, make informed decisions regarding pricing, marketing, and purchasing decisions.
